## What it does

Agri-Wealth is a fully functional, end-to-end prototype built with no-code tools. It includes:
- A **Farmer App** for user registration and waste pickup requests.
- An **Admin App** for managing logistics and new requests.
- An **AI Chatbot** trained on specific data to answer farmer queries about prices.
- A **Backend Automation System** for sending real-time alerts and welcome emails.

## How we built it

- **Frontend & Database:** **Glide** and **Google Sheets** were used to rapidly build the mobile apps and manage the data.
- **Backend Automation:** **Zapier** acts as the central nervous system, connecting our Google Sheet to Gmail for all backend workflows.
- **AI Brain:** **Dante AI** was used to create and train the AI assistant on our custom data.

## Workflow Architecture

`Glide App (User Input) -> Google Sheet (Database) -> Zapier (Automation) -> Gmail (Notification)`
`Glide App (User Input) -> Dante AI (Chatbot)`
